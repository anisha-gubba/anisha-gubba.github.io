<ul><h1><strong>Advice for budding cartoonists</strong></h1>
<p><li><h3>Read as much as you can.</h3>
<p>The best way to get inspired to draw your own comics is to read what others have done before you. Try looking at the graphic novel sections in your library, or look at eBooks, if you'd prefer. You can also read the comics section in your local newspaper for something easier to access. My all-time favorite strip is <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>, which isn't featured in all newspapers (except those that do reruns), as the cartoonist quit some time ago, but still has comic collections selling in bookstores and available in libraries. For longer graphic novels, I like anything by Raina Telgemeier (her website <a href = "http://goraina.com/">here</a>). I also read manga on occasion. </li>

<p><li><h3>Make your own mini-comics.</h3>
<p>If you can't get any fancy copyright and publishing, just do it yourself! Make your own comic books and self-publish. Keep them for yourself, or show them to your friends and family if you're comfortable doing so. It's okay if it's just a small booklet made of printer paper and stapled together; that's how you get practice. </li>

<p><li><h3>Draw as much as you can.</h3>
<p>If you're finished with an assignment and there's ten minutes left in class (provided you have nothing else that you absolutely have to do), take out some paper and a pencil and start drawing! Drawing isn't a right-or-wrong kind of thing, like sports or music. The more you do it, the more developed your style will be. Try drawing as a wind-down before bed, or as a wake-up in the morning (as long as you didn't oversleep). I almost always keep a sketchbook wherever I go, and some people may wonder why, but it means I can draw wherever I am. Go out of your comfort zone in drawing something you wouldn't normally draw. Draw the people in your life. There is no limit to what you can do. </li>

<p><li><h3>Find a good environment.</h3>
<p>I don't know about you, but there are times when I feel like I just can't focus on drawing. Sometimes it really helps to find a space that is an especially good workspace, such as a room in your house or a library or something. If you can't find a specific space or don't have the time, find something that helps you immerse yourself in your art, like for me, I love listening to music when I draw. Of course this tip isn't absolutely necessary, but I just find it useful.</li>

<p><li><h3>Experiment with more materials.</h3>
<p>If you want to make more advanced work, try inking or coloring in your work. I use a six-pack of Staedtler pigment liner pens, each with a different thickness, as they work rather well and aren't very costly, but there are dozens of special materials for inking out there. To color in something I've drawn, I keep it simple - I use watercolor markers or colored pencils, but I see copic markers to be very nice, although they're quite expensive. If all else fails, just use the materials you have in your home. Simple is better than nothing.</li>

<p><li><h3>Make it about your life.</h3>
<p>One of my favorite things to do is draw about experiences I've had, which includes making the characters of the people in my life. If you can't think of a storyline, think of a good (or bad) memory you've had. Make a comic about it. Again, this is just a suggestion, but I find autobiographical cartoons super fun and meaningful.</li>

<p><li><h3>Never say that you can't draw.</h3>
<p>When my friends hear that I enjoy drawing cartoons, many claim they "can't draw", which isn't true at all. I understand that drawing isn't everyone's thing, but it's not a can-or-can't deal. It's more of a will-or-won't, or even better, do-or-don't sort of thing. Nobody "can't" draw. It's whether you're wanting to and willing to that makes the difference.</li>
